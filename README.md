# Counting apples from the [Minneapple dataset](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/206575) 


*Made in colaboration with [Emil Delvaux](https://github.com/emildel)*



My first proper crash into neural networks.



## Segmentation using color channels

Simple segmentation based on brightness components.

Images are split, equalized, thresholded and filtered with morphological operations before separated into clusters.


 - Using [RGB](https://github.com/RobotKitchen/AppleCounting/blob/main/Approach1_HSVSegmentation.ipynb) color channels, red channel used as base, and others extracted.
 - Using [HSV](https://github.com/RobotKitchen/AppleCounting/blob/main/Approach1_RedChannelSegmentation.ipynb) color channels, using brightness component.
 - Using [Both](https://github.com/RobotKitchen/AppleCounting/blob/main/Approach1_RGBHSVSegmentation.ipynb) composite approach, using best of the previous.

## Basic CNN implementation from scratch in two parts:

 - [Design and training](https://github.com/RobotKitchen/AppleCounting/blob/main/Approach2_MachineTraining.ipynb) of the CNN, using the counting dataset from Minneapple. Structure and weights saved for later.
 - [Using the CNN](https://github.com/RobotKitchen/AppleCounting/blob/main/Approach2_Counter.ipynb). Splitting the image into chunks, feeding each one into the trained network and summing up the total of apples.


## Verdict

Overall results are... not the greatest, quite bad actually with an error of around +-30% from truth. 

As a learning experience however, the project was extremely rewarding, allowing us to crash headfirst into traditional and NN segmentation techniques.
